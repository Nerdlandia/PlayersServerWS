1. install postgres
http://www.postgresql.org/download/
2. postgres gui admin tool (pgadmin)
http://www.pgadmin.org/

3. install node
https://nodejs.org/

4. You will need to create 2 folders, server and client
server will act as your node middlelayer

The client and server files are at github.com/nerdlandia.  You will need both a client and a server.
The *Vs (Visual Studio) solutions require that you install the (free) Visual Studio Tools for Node.

Server
5. install the following npm (node package manager) packages:
	a. pm (support for postgres)
	b. express (http/web)
	c. body-parser (access to elements of controls)
	d. dateformat (date processing)
example: c:> npm install pg	
6. in server.js, change the connection string to attach to #1

You can now fire up the server c:> node server.js
To test: chrome and firefox (ie?) have extensions that can be
used to test your api. 

Client
The addresses of the server and ports are located in services.js, in the
Settings factory at approximately line 78.

The ionic "getting started" walks you through the process of setting up your machine
at http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/ .  Note that it also has videos to do so.
Also, they have you installing node, which you did above.
Plan on the java and android sdk (including phone images) taking up at least 4G.

You will see that there three projects: blank, tabs, and sidemenu.  The app in 
github.com/nerdlandia uses the tabs project. Use our files from client/www:
index.html
all in \js
all in \templates
